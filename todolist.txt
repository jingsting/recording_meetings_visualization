PRIORITY:
Work with lunar landing data to get ready for demo —> have visualizations ready with lunar landing data for meeting on Monday

To do:
1. Choose new color scheme for bubbles
2. Decide if we want to keep the current layout or consider changing it to fit our future needs
        Check out original visualizations brainstorm slide show and decide
        Hui suggested changing the color for how long they speak and increase the width of the outline stroke for the number of times they spoke
              Would eliminate need to resize bubbles (most likely)
3. Have an indicator of the person who has spoken the least in the meeting
        A way to have the visualization make a “suggestion” to balance the meeting
4. Find a way to show multi-modal part of spatial context
        Create a head pose indicator using arrows
        Find a way to show where on the screen people are looking (using gaze pixel location)
              Junjie is working on this, we may just want to find a way to incorporate it into the visualization

Brainstorming/Suggestions:
1. Changes to visualization keeping in mind adding spatial data as well as dialogue acts
2. As adding dialogue act incorporation will happen soon, brainstorm more ways we may be able to represent these dialogue acts in the Level 2 visualization, possibly both visualizations
3. Ideas for representing the head pose
4. Ideas for indicating who has spoke the least
      Possibly based on amount of time as that is a better indicator of participation
