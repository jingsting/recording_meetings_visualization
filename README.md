# recording_meetings_visualization
This is based off of the old database files but I will be changing it to read from the new database files. It only reads in from the speech
collection and one of the user collections as of right now because those are the basic files for the visualizations.

Create a folder called api that will contain two folders: models and routes. Models should contain speech.js and user.js while 
routes should contain speeches.js and users.js. The api folder should be with the other files. 

Packages needed: express, mongoose, and body-parser
